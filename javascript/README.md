Sorting!
========

This directory contains solutions to the Sorting! challenge in
`JavaScript`.

Usage
-----

Use the `run` command to execute the sorter. When called without an
argument it will provide a usage summary with the available sorters.

``` sh
> ./run
usage: run SORTER
where SORTER is one of:
	standard
```

When run with one of the mentioned sorters it will start a repl. In
this reply you can enter comma separated numbers and the loop will
sort them.

``` sh
> ./run standard
> 3,2,1
1,2,3
> 2,3,1
1,2,3
```
