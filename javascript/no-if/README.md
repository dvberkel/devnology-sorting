Sorting! JavaScript
===================

This is a JavaScript solution to the Sorting! challenge that uses no
condintionals. I.e. no `if`, no `switch`, no `?:` and no `while`.

Don't trust me? Run the following command on the code base and it will
not return a single line.

```sh
find . -name '*.js' | grep -v node_modules | xargs grep 'if'
```
